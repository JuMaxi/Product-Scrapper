## This is a Work in Progress


In this project, my purpose is to build a **Scrapper** that will monitor some websites filtering a *Key Word = Product* and send the results of this search by email to the user. Also, I added the functionality filtering more than one Keyword, sending both results by email. And, it's possible to save a user (email) to send the results according to keywords indexed.

For that, I'm using HTTP Requests to get the searches from websites such as eBay, GumTree, Thash Nothing, and so on, reading the HTML and returning the results through an Endpoint. 

To build this project, I'm using **Interfaces**, **Inheritance**, **XPath**, and **SQL**.
